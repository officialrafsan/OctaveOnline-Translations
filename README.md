# Octave Online Server Translations

This project contains localized UI strings for Octave Online Server (OOS).

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/octave-online/oos-translations/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/octave-online/oos-translations/actions)

## Contributing New Translations

Create a new file under the *locales/* directory.  Start from *en.json* and copy it to your new language, such as *zz.json*.  Then edit each string to be translated into your language.

Every string has a description.  Please use the description to determine the correct tense for verbs.  For example, "button text" means that the verb should use the tense most often found on a button in your language.

## Importing New Strings from OOS

From this directory, run:

```bash
$ ./bin/i18next2chrome.js -i path/to/oo-projects/front/locales -o locales
```
